\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper provides an artifact for analyzing event logs from \gls{vcs}. Our tool is able to visualize the type of work that was executed in a software development process. Starting from fine-grained changes in the different versions of files, it allows to understand what activity was done and when. It also provides important KPIs, such as the effort distribution. These features are important for managers to understand whether the project is deviating from target goals, and in case take corrective actions.

In the future, efforts will be made to integrate the ActiVCS tool with the Gantt chart miner from~\cite{DBLP:conf/bpm/BalaCMRP}. This would offer to the project manager complementary views on the current status of the project. We plan to conduct user studies with managers in order to receive more feedback from domain experts. Finally, we have already conducted a study on selecting \glspl{kpi} for software development and we plan to incorporate them in the ActiVCS tool.
