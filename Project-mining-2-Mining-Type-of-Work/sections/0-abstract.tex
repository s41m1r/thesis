This makes it hard to apply mining techniques for monitoring the process. 
A key challenge for using traces of tools such as version control systems (VCS) is to find meaningful abstractions in order to identify the work that was actually done. 
In this paper, we use data from VCS to analyze the actual progress of software-development processes. We develop a technique that is able to mine the activity types of which the development processes consists. 
We implement our technique as a prototype in Java and evaluate its outputs in terms of effectiveness.
In this way, we are able to graphically uncover new behavioural patterns in real-world data from existing open-source GitHub repositories.
