%\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces artifact A1. It develops concepts to capture software development as a specific types of process, namely project-oriented. 
The rest of this chapter is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2015background} describes the research problem and summarizes insights from prior research upon which our project mining approach is built. \Cref{sec:bpm2015related} describes the related work. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2015concept} defines the preliminaries of our work and presents an algorithm to mine project-oriented business processes. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2015evaluation} describes the implementation of this algorithm and discusses the results from its application to VCS logs from a real-world engineering project. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2015discuss} highlights the implications of this work before Section~\ref{sec:bpm2015outro} concludes.
