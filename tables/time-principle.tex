		Context                    & {in the context of project-oriented business processes (i.e., one-shot business processes)}                                                       \\
		Mechanism                  & {identify how low-level event data can be mapped to higher-level business activities and keep a time-aware representation}                        \\
		Rationale                  & {because it becomes easier for a manager to understand non compliant work patterns by looking at what kind of work was done in which time period} \\ \bottomrule
