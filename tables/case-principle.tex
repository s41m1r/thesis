		\textbf{Design principle title} & \textbf{Extracting the case perspective of project-oriented business processes}                                             \\ \midrule
		Aim, implementer, and user &
		For researchers and professionals (implementers), to enable the project manager (user) to gather understanding of hidden relations among the artifacts worked on by developers (aim) \\
		Context                         & in the context of the software development projects                                                                         \\
		Mechanism                       & identify similarities in the evolution between software components (i.e., the files containing the code of such components) \\
		Rationale &
		because a \emph{case} in software development concerns the work that is done in order to complete an implemenation task. 
		%According principles of software modularization the implementation should apply changes to  modules which should be loosely-coupled.
