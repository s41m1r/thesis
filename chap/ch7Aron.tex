\section{The Conversational Structure of Problem-Solution Co-Evolution}
\label{sec:conversational-structure}

This section investigates on how control happens in \gls{oss}. Especially, we investigate on the how collaborative processes unfold when several users are free to join existing software projects as contributors. To gather insights on this process, we focus on the conversational aspect of the collaboration. To this end, we used speech act theory to analyze conversations between developers. We generated as dataset from manually encoded \glspl{pr} into speech acts \citep{searle1985expression}. Then, we analyzed these data through log analyses techniques and were able to pinpoint the nature of such conversational processes. The following sections describe the problem, approach and findings.

\subsection{Control Mechanisms in Software Development}

Open source software (OSS) development has become an important domain for studies who seek to explain the dynamics of new ways of organizing. In particular, \gls{floss} projects have been brought as an example of innovative ways of self-organizing \citep{DBLP:journals/mansci/KroghH06,DBLP:journals/misq/HowisonC14}. Works in literature have emphasized iterations (\citealp{Berente2005,Berente2007}), self-organization \citep{DBLP:journals/infsof/CrowstonLWEH07,DBLP:journals/jss/HodaM16} and free-speech \citep{DBLP:conf/chiir/ThomasCMCM18,Gibson2019}. 
%2. What is the overall problem or situation in that domain

Initiatives like the free software movement have often been understood as ``taking freedom" in participating to open source projects, studying its underlying ideas, changing the code, and redistributing the code to other users who are allowed the same freedom. In other words, open source software development has been seen as a libertarian practice (i.e., emphasizing individualism, freedom of choice and voluntary association) \citep{stallman2002free}. However, it has been shown that control mechanisms (be there social or institutional) are present in the area \citep{Lindberg2016}. In particular, online collaborative work that generates knowledge goes through "negotiation" actions which “pull” the trajectory and shape its movement in the feature space \citep{Arazy2020}. Therefore, it remains underexplored whether open source software development to what extent \gls{oss} is institutionalized and what are its similarities to corporate bureaucracy.


In the following, we addresses the problem of freedom in open source development by comparing it to corporate bureaucracy. We analyze pull requests from a real world open source repository using speech act theory. This, in combination with data analysis techniques and process mining, allows us to untangle interesting insights about OSS development and point out relevant resemblance to stage-gate processes. 

\Cref{fig:conversational-approach} gives an overview of the adopted approach for analyzing the processes that lie behind collaborative work. It follows a three-step process. First, we generate a structured dataset of the conversations from a number of software repositories. Second, we create an enriched event log which contains a mapping of each conversation to one or more speech acts. Third, we analyze the enriched event log to gather process insights on the conversation. Finally, we use these insights to better understand the domain. Next, we describe each of the steps.

\subsubsection{Generating the dataset}

Our approach focuses on data from Github\footnote{https://github.com}, which stores more than 42 million public repositories\footnote{https://github.com/search?q=is:public}. A repository may contain several pieces of information related to software development such as a record of all the changes to the codebase, documentation and configuration files, and a forum that enables users to communicate with one another through message posting. 

In this context, collaboration happens as follows. When users want to contribute to an existing project, they first clone the repository into their local machine. After they have made the desired contribution (e.g., implemented a new feature) they need to make a request for integrating their contribution to the main codebase. Such request takes the name of \glsfirst{pr}. Pull requests have to undergo code-reviews in before the code is accepted and integrated to the code base. Such code-reviews are accompanied by conversations about the status of the work and may require several iterations before the code is ready to be merged or is the change is not accepted. Finally, the \gls{pr} can be closed. 

In order to generate a dataset from \glspl{pr} we proceed as follows. Aware of several perils \citep{DBLP:journals/ese/KalliamvakouGBS16} of using Github data, we selected a repository that is active and has been widely studied in other works \citep{Zhang2016,Lindberg2016,DBLP:conf/wcre/ConstantinouM17}. We wrote a script that extracts the first 600 pages of the Ruby on Rails (rails/rails) repository\footnote{https://github.com/rails/rails} as of March 2019. 
In order to have information about the complete lifecycle of conversations, we only extracted \glspl{pr} that were closed. This resulted in a dataset that comprised \glspl{pr} between August 2012 and February 2019. 

As a result we could organize the dataset in a tabular format that contains the following columns. \emph{Pull request number} is a unique identifier for each \gls{pr}. \emph{First user} is the person who opened the \gls{pr}. \emph{Status} indicates the decision taken on the \gls{pr} (i.e., merged or not merged). \emph{Timestamps} provide temporal information about when a \gls{pr} was opened and closed. \emph{Text} reports the comment from users. \emph{User} is the person who posted the comment. \emph{Timestamp} is the time in which the comment was posted. 


\subsubsection{Creating the enriched dataset}

This phase takes as input the structured dataset created previously and generates a new dataset in which each comment is mapped to a set of speech acts. 
We adopted the taxonomy provided by \cite{DBLP:journals/cscw/RipocheS06}. This taxonomy adapts the original work of \cite{searle1985expression} to the computer science domain. We further adapted their taxonomy to the Github conversations. In particular, we use the categories described in \Cref{tab:speech-act-types}. 

\input{tables/speech-act-types}

We have further adapted the taxonomy to accommodate the discourse elements found in pull requests by grouping existing sub-categories and adding new elements. First, we have grouped together the categories \emph{statement} and \emph{description} as there is no substantial difference when it comes to pull requests. Then, we also grouped together  \emph{prescription} and \emph{requirement}, \emph{instruction} and \emph{suggestion}, \emph{opinion} and \emph{expression},  \emph{acknowledgments} and \emph{agreement}, and \emph{exclamation} and \emph{exmoji}. By combining these classes, we easy the task of categorizing comments. This is especially important when it comes to building an automatic classifier. 

We also included an additional category \emph{Others} to express three further speech acts we able to find in \glspl{pr}, respectively \emph{code}, \emph{welcome comment} (or simply \emph{welcome}) and \emph{citation}. Code indicates a fragment of code in the \gls{pr}. Welcome comment, indicates an automatic text generated by a bot in the moment a pull request is open. Citation indicates any part in which there is a reference to a previous comment. In the latter case, the citation may also quote an existing comment. The quoted message is treated as a duplicate in the annotation phase. 

To annotate the various posts we proceed as follows. We scan all the sentences of the post and find all the speech acts. Thus, each post is annotated with multiple speech act categories. First, we check whether a message falls into category \emph{Other}. This category is exclusive (i.e., the message is not further labeled with other speech acts). For example, all messages generated by a bot are classified into the welcome category and no other categories are allowed. All the rest, is classified into one of the remaining categories. Each sentence can have multiple speech acts. However, a word is only categorized into one specific speech act. An exception are the categories \emph{summon} and \emph{emoji} as they can express multiple speech acts. \Cref{tab:annotation-rules} summarizes the annotation rules.

\input{tables/annotation-rules}

\subsubsection{Performing log analysis and gathering insights}

After the dataset is annotated with speech acts, the next step is to apply analyses tools in order to gather insights. 
In order to do so, we exploit process mining tools like Disco and ProM. These tools enable us to perform several types of analyses, including basic statistics, trace and model-based. The input of these techniques is an event log in the \gls{xes} or CSV format. 

The outcome of this step is a set of insights about the conversational process. Especially, we are interested in the analyses that may unveil corporate bureaucracy aspects in \gls{oss}. In particular, we look into 
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape i)]
	\item how the different speech acts are distributed and what are the characteristics of the different types of pull requests
	\item whether there are pattern of users who represent central decision makers, and
	\item what speech acts are associated to the different users.
\end{inparaenum}



\subsection{Results}

In the following, we describe the results of this approach on the Ruby on Rails repository. 

\subsubsection{Speech acts distribution and pull request process}

The manually annotated 2072 \glspl{pr} from the Ruby on Rails\footnote{https://github.com/rails/rails} repository have the following distribution of speech acts. Statements and descriptions are by far the most common types of speech. This is also in line with findings from previous studies \citep{DBLP:journals/cscw/RipocheS06,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/WoodRAM18} about conversations in this domain. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/speechActCount}
	\caption[Speech act categories manually annotated on Rails project]{Distribution of the speech act categories in the manually annotated conversations of the Rails project}
	\label{fig:speechactcount}
\end{figure}


Other frequent categories are acknowledgment, action, code, opinion, question, requirement, suggestion, summon or thank. These categories were found in ten to twenty percent of the posts. There are also quite evenly distributed, suggesting that these categories are represent the types of speech which are actually used, while statement seems like a \emph{must-have} speech act. The remaining categories occurred below ten percent and they may be considered as unusual speech acts. The category \emph{welcome} is not reported in the plot as it only occurred three times. 


Next, we are interested in understanding how the process of contributing to the code base works. Especially, we want to investigate whether there is any difference between \glspl{pr} which were merged and those which were not merged. To this end, we split the event log into two sub-logs $L_1$ and $L_2$, containing respectively the traces of the conversations which led to a merge and the traces of the conversations which were not accepted to be included the code-base. 

However, simply applying any process discovery technique yields models which are too complex to analyze (aka \emph{Spaghetti}). \Cref{fig:notmerged-a100-p50} shows an example of such model. The model was obtain using the process discovery algorithm of the Disco tool. Moreover, the model shows all the activities contained in the event log and only the 50\% most frequent paths connecting any two activities. Yet, the model is not useful for analyses. Therefore, a further simplification step is needed. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/not-merged-a100-p50}
	\caption[A spaghetti model derived from the Ruby dataset]{A spaghetti model derived from the Ruby dataset, showing all the possible activities and the 50\% most frequent paths}
	\label{fig:notmerged-a100-p50}
\end{figure}


In order to obtain a more useful model we perform simplification on two levels: event log and model. On the event log level we group the activities into groups with similar characteristics. For example, question and request can be grouped together because they ask something. \Cref{tab:aggregated-categories} reports the grouping. 

\input{tables/speechActMacroCategories}

On the model level, we use the \gls{gui} sliders offered by Disco. In this way we are able to further simplify the number of elements of the discovered process model. Finally, we apply process discovery on the event logs $L_1$ and $L_2$. \Cref{fig:speechActProcess} shows these processes. For both processes, we the \emph{activity} parameter to 25\% (i.e., we keep only the 25\% most frequent activities) and the \emph{path} parameter to zero (i.e., we discard alternative paths between any two activities).

\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The conversational process of merged and non merged pull requests}
	\label{fig:speechActProcess}
\end{figure}

In both processes, the macro activity \emph{StaAct} (statement, action) is frequent. Such activity is usually found as a starter of the pull request. In the case of merged \glspl{pr}, the process usually ends with a \emph{ThaAck} or \emph{QueRec}. Conversely, in the case of non merged pull requests, the process may end with four different activities. While \emph{ThaAck} and \emph{QueRec} are also present in this process, only \emph{ThaAck} is executed as a final activity. Moreover, a final activity that we see only in the case of non merged \glspl{pr} is \emph{Dis} (i.e., 
Disagreement). This helps understanding why non merged \glspl{pr} take longer to close. 

\subsubsection{Gate keepers in OSS}

Next, we analyze whether there are central user who act as quality controllers. Quality controllers are central points in the process where a decision is taken whether to proceed or kill the processes. Such processes are also known as stage-gate\textregistered  \citep{cooper2008perspective}. Decision points are known as \emph{gates}. In each gate it is decided whether the process should continue or be interrupted. People in charge of these decisions take the name of \emph{gatekeepers}. In the following, we identify gatekeepers in the Rails project.

We implemented a prototype that takes as input the structured dataset generated in the previous steps and constructs a graph of the social network among users who participate in the project. The graph is constructed as follows. Each user is a vertex. For each pair of users, we draw and edge whether they have been involved in a conversation throughout the whole history of the input data. We enrich this graph with additional information as follows. Users who are core members are represented with a square, whereas other members with a circle. An edge connecting two users is thicker when users have been involved more with one another. If a pull request involving any two users has been successful, we color the edge in green, otherwise the edge is colored in gray. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/socio-graph}
	\caption[Subgraph of all the interactions in a group]{Subgraph of all the interactions that happened within a connected component in a social network.}
	\label{fig:socio-graph}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:socio-graph} shows a subgraph from the Rails project. To implement the prototype we used graphstream\footnote{https://graphstream-project.org}, a Java library for representing and working with dynamic graphs \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0803-2093}. In this subgraph, we can observe that there are five users who are represented by red squares. Those are core members of the Ruby on Rails project. Four of these members, are also the nodes with highest centrality. Thus, decisions about the destiny of a \gls{pr} depend rather on the people with high centrality \citep{singh2020centrality,DBLP:journals/snam/Doostmohammadian20} than on democratic coordination (e.g., voting). 

\subsubsection{User specialization}

Next, we investigate what speech acts are associated to the different users. To do so, we create a dataset that associations from each user to the speech acts used in the history of the \glspl{pr}. We include an attribute that indicates the type of user (i.e., core member, contributor or none of the two). Further, we also calculate the weight of each speech used by each user over the overall amount of times that speech act occurred. We can use this information to create the plot in \Cref{fig:speech-act-types-per-user}.

We can now observe the distribution of the speech acts across the different user types in the repository. Users are represented on the x-axis. The y-axis shows how  many  times  a  user  uses  a  specific  speech act. Shapes indicate the different roles that a user covers. Colors indicate what type of speech act that was used. For example, the figure tells us that user \emph{kamipo} has used the speech act of type \emph{statement} about 90 times. It also tells us that this user is a core member. By crossing the information from this chart and the previous social-network, we can observe that user \emph{kaspth}, who is a core member with a high centrality in the social network, often uses the speech acts types \emph{question}, \emph{suggestion}, \emph{statement} and \emph{thank}. This is in line with studies on how leaders promote dialogic discussion \citep{lemmetty2020moment} and influence engagement \citep{rabiul2021leadership}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/speechActTypesPerUser}
	\caption{Speech act categories per user type}
	\label{fig:speech-act-types-per-user}
\end{figure}


Finally, combining insights from the quantitative analyses, the process analysis, the social network of users, and the distribution of the various users over the projects, we can gather insights that which show an hierarchy and imbalance of power in software projects. For instance, successfully merged pull requests mostly involved the same users. These users can be seen as quality controllers. Therefore, the do not contribute to the conversation as peers but rather as leaders, supervisors, or persons at a higher level of a hierarchy. Their actions are also decisive about the conversation (i.e., they can decide when the process is considered to be complete).
