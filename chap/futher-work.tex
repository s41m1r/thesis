The techniques presented in this dissertation fall under the broader category of analyses methods based on trace data. When used individually they provide specific insights about determinate perspective of a process. These methods can also be combined with one another in order to achieve a more complete picture about how the process performs under the different perspectives. Beyond measuring performance of processes, trace-data methods can be exploited in combination with other methods to aid theory development~\citep{DBLP:journals/isr/BerenteSS19}.

This chapter presents two more approaches that leverage trace data to gather insights on the software development. \Cref{sec:combining-questionnaier-and-trace} explores a mixed-method approach to identify relevant software development elements. It combines a subjective perspective from questionnaires and data analyses from event logs. As a result, insights are gathered on what elements both considered important and are actually used. \Cref{sec:conversational-structure} presents an approach that leverages speech act theory to understand how conversation about software development unfold. As a result, it is possible to observe differences in the process of successful collaboration.
