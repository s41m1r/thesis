\chapter{Discovering the Temporal Perspective}

\todo[inline]{BPM1. Organize the chapter.}

%The class of processes that we discuss in this chapter are long-term engineering
%projects. These processes have specific requirements for monitoring. First, they
%are executed only once according to the specific needs of a particular project, and
%only partially according to recurring process descriptions. Second, they involve
%various actors that typically document their work in a semi-structured way using
%text and tables. Third, work in the project is usually subject to constraints
%regarding the start and end and the temporal order. Fourth, there is typically
%no process engine controlling the execution. Fifth, even though these limitations
%in terms of traceability exist, there are usually strong requirements in terms of
%tracking when which work was conducted.
