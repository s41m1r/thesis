\chapter{Article 1: Mining Project-Oriented Business Processes}

%The class of processes that we discuss in this chapter are long-term engineering
%projects. These processes have specific requirements for monitoring. First, they
%are executed only once according to the specific needs of a particular project, and
%only partially according to recurring process descriptions. Second, they involve
%various actors that typically document their work in a semi-structured way using
%text and tables. Third, work in the project is usually subject to constraints
%regarding the start and end and the temporal order. Fourth, there is typically
%no process engine controlling the execution. Fifth, even though these limitations
%in terms of traceability exist, there are usually strong requirements in terms of
%tracking when which work was conducted.

\noindent Large engineering processes need to be monitored in detail regarding when what was done in order to prove compliance with rules and regulations. A typical problem of these processes is the lack of control that a central process engine provides, such that it is difficult to track the actual course of work even if data is stored in version control systems (VCS). In this paper, we address this problem by defining a mining technique that helps to generate models that visualize the work history as GANTT charts. To this end, we formally define the notion of a project-oriented business process and a corresponding mining algorithm. Our evaluation based on a prototypical implementation demonstrates the benefits in comparison to existing process mining approaches for this specific class of processes.
