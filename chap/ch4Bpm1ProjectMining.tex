\chapter{Discovering the Temporal Perspective}

%The class of processes that we discuss in this chapter are long-term engineering
%projects. These processes have specific requirements for monitoring. First, they
%are executed only once according to the specific needs of a particular project, and
%only partially according to recurring process descriptions. Second, they involve
%various actors that typically document their work in a semi-structured way using
%text and tables. Third, work in the project is usually subject to constraints
%regarding the start and end and the temporal order. Fourth, there is typically
%no process engine controlling the execution. Fifth, even though these limitations
%in terms of traceability exist, there are usually strong requirements in terms of
%tracking when which work was conducted.

%Here goes the contribution from BPM1.

\todo[inline]{
	Make cover page. Example:
	This chapter presents the central research results, which relate to methods and
	techniques for quantifying inconsistency in business rule bases, pin-pointing elements
	responsible for the overall inconsistency, and resolving inconsistency. The
	results and their interrelations are also summarized in a concluding discussion.
	As stated in the disclaimer, the following results have already been published
	in various works. Subsequently, the following section includes many materials of
	these works, which are cited accordingly. All original material was written by
	myself, except if explicitly stated otherwise.
