\Extrachap{Abstract}

Software development is a highly flexible endeavor. Yet, software development projects
have specific requirements about quality, costs and time to deliver. Therefore, there is need
for monitoring and controlling the software development process. This problem is tackled
separately by three different disciplines, but existing approaches still fail at delivering process
knowledge about software development that can be easily understood by managers. This
dissertation develops novel methods and algorithms that can be used to extract process
knowledge from software development trace data. As a result, it can be positioned as a
bridge between the process mining discipline and the area of software engineering. From
a research point of view, the outcomes of this dissertation are a building block to further
cross-fertilize research streams on process mining and software engineering. From a practical
point of view, the outcomes of this dissertation allow the project manager to obtain a more
familiar means of analysis on software development such as a process view.
