\abstract*{The monitoring of project-oriented business processes is difficult because their state is fragmented and represented by the progress

\section{Monitoring the Work History of Software Projects}

\todo[inline]{rephrase}

In this section, we focus on a specific class of project-oriented business processes,
namely software development processes. These processes share some common
characteristics. First, they involve various resources with different roles. In the
simplest case, we can distinguish project managers and project participants.
Project managers are responsible for managing the development process and
supervising the work of the project participants, who in turn are responsible for
specific work tasks. Second, such processes are usually subject to constraints in
terms of cost, time and quality, which is mostly associated with the performance
of each of the work tasks. Third, the project participants work on a plethora of
artifacts, which are logically organized in a hierarchical structure, with complex
interdependencies among them. Given these characteristics, it is the goal of theproject manager to organize the software development process in such a way
that the work on different files and tasks reflects the complex interdependencies,
the constraints and the available participants. Therefore, it is important for the
manager to understand the work history of the process in order to monitor the
progress systematically.

This chapter is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2017background} describes the research problem along with its requirements and summarizes insights from prior research. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2017approach} presents our approach in detail. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2017evaluation} shows a prototypical implementation and evaluates its applicability both in a use case scenario and on real world projects from GitHub. Section~\ref{sec:bpm2017conclusion} concludes the paper.
