\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:threats}

This paper presents some limitations. First, we make assumptions on the meaningfulness of the directory structure, the comments and we rely on the fact that users systematically commit their changes. While this is a good practice in software development, it is not always the case in real life projects. 
Another limitation regards the visualization of the projects. At the current state the visualizing big projects is a challenge due to the growing number visual elements that must be represented. We plan to overcome this obstacle by adding collapsing and expanding feature in order to hide or show the processes at a given level of the directory structure.
Finally, the current times series comparison takes into account only files that change together at the same time and not files who change as a consequence of another change at a previous point in time. This is means that users should promptly react to changes, which is not necessarily true in real projects.
