\subsection{Scenario of Use}
\label{subsec:scenario}
%In this section, an example of the application of our approach to a software development project is described.

The scenario describes a software development project. It contains $12$ files arranged hierarchically as depicted by the file tree in Figure \ref{fig_fileTreeExample}.

At the first level of the file tree there is the README.md file. This is typically used to describe the project. The software product in our case is called \emph{running example} and is contained in the $f_5$. The product consists of an example for software developers who want to organize their projects according to a predefined structure. 

%There are several resources  that collaborate in the project. Their roles are shown in \Cref{tab:resource-roles}. According to the role, each resource has a typical scope on the project, e.g., \emph{John} is the project manager and can work on all the project, \emph{Mary} is a graphic designer and she can only work on the visualization.

The software development project has 21 commits, which check in changes happened over 10 days. Table \ref{tab:vcs-log-data} illustrates an excerpt from the VCS log of this scenario of use. The project managers are interested in understanding the work process done by project participants in each of the files and whether there is some dependency between them that may emerge from the data. We now show how our approach can fulfill this requirements, by applying  each step of our approach to this project example and discussing the outcomes.

%As described in Section \ref{} the first step of the approach is the generation of file process considering story mining techniques. Based on the comments presented in Table \ref{} the process for all four files were generated. Next the method to extract dependencies between files is run. For that the time series with the amount of change for each file is generated. Considering the correlation between the files the dependencies are found. Figure \ref{} depicts the proposed visualization of the 3 perspectives of a file.
