\subsection{Discussion.}

\Cref{subsub:example} shows that time series analysis can help uncovering work dependencies that are not captured by existing approaches in literature which leverage on social network analysis~\cite{Zimmermann2008,Weicheng2013}. On the other hand, our technique is currently not yet able to retrieve dependencies with delay. We plan to address this challenge by using moving-average time series models.
%However, we argue that on the long run, under the assumption that \gls{vcs} is used in the everyday work, the technique can be useful to further
