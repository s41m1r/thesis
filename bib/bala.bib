	abstract = {Software projects typically need to be monitored in detail regarding when what was done in order to demonstrate adherence to methodologies, rules, regulations, guidelines or best practices. To this end, it is of utmost importance to obtain factual knowledge from empirical evidence about the actual software development process. A major problem in this context is the lack of a centralized control of by a central system. Although it is hard to obtain full knowledge of the overall software development process, several cues can be gathered by analyzing pieces of information that are stored by supporting IT systems (e.g., issue trackers and version control). This position paper presents research in progress for extracting process knowledge from the historical data of software artifacts. This work extends the applicability of process mining techniques to software processes.},

To create complete, valid and reliable planning and customization process data for a product deployment, an overarching engineering process is crucial for the successful completion of a project. In this paper, we introduce a framework for process management in complex engineering projects which are subject to a large amount of constraints and make use of heterogeneous data sources. In addition, we propose solutions for the framework components and describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the framework as an extension of a well-known BPMS.",

	abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors. Complex engineering projects, such as the deployment of a railway infrastructure or the installation of an interlocking system, involve human safety and make use of heterogeneous data sources, as well as customized engineering tools. These processes are currently carried out in an ad-hoc fashion, relying on the experience of experts who need to plan, control, and monitor the execution of processes for delivering value to the customers. This setting makes an automated overarching-process a crucial step towards supporting engineers and project managers to deal with safety-critical constraints and the plethora of details entailed by the process. This paper demonstrates a tool that combines methods from automatic reasoning, ontologies and process mining, implemented on top of a real Business Process Management System (BPMS).},

@inproceedings{Bala2017b,
	abstract = {Companies working on safety-critical projects must adhere to strict rules imposed by the domain, especially when human safety is involved. These projects need to be compliant to standard norms and regulations. Thus, all the process steps must be clearly documented in order to be verifiable for compliance in a later stage by an auditor. Nevertheless, documentation often comes in the form of manually written textual documents in different formats. Moreover, the project members use diverse proprietary tools. This makes it difficult for auditors to understand how the actual project was conducted. My research addresses the project mining problem by exploiting logs from project-generated artifacts, which come from software repositories used by the project team.},

	abstract = {Collaboration in business processes and projects requires a division of responsibilities among the participants. Version control systems allow us to collect profiles of the participants that hint at participants' roles in the collaborative work. The goal of this paper is to automatically classify participants into the roles they fulfill in the collaboration. Two approaches are proposed and compared in this paper. The first approach finds classes of users by applying k-means clustering to users based on attributes calculated for them. The classes identified by the clustering are then used to build a decision tree classification model. The second approach classifies individual commits based on commit messages and file types. The distribution of commit types is used for creating a decision tree classification model. The two approaches are implemented and tested against three real datasets, one from academia and two from industry. Our classification covers 86{\%} percent of the total commits. The results are evaluated with actual role information that was manually collected from the teams responsible for the analyzed repositories. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},
