Furthermore, organisations are facing a lot of pressure to use SDM (Fitzgerald, 1996). Despite the high investment in the development of SDM and the pressure to use it, their practical usefulness is still a controversial issue (Fitzgerald, 1996; Introna and Whitley, 1997; Nandhakumar and Avison, 1999). While many organisations claim that they do not use any methodologies (Hardy et al., 1995; Chatzoglou and Macauly, 1996; Fitzgerald, 1998), others are using it with positive results (Chatzoglou and Macauly, 1996; Rahim et al.,1998). Apart from this, we do not know why SDM are used or not used, or what factors influence its use and effectiveness.},
