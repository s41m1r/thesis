Thus far, this type of awareness has focused only on individual developers, with information regarding individual artifacts provided in a contextualized visualization. Here, we build upon our prior work, but take a broader perspective: visualization and exploration of workspace activity and evolution on a project-wide basis. We believe this visualization helps project managers who now have a comprehensive view of all project activities, allowing them to intelligently steer development and adjust task assignments. Developers can also benefit from this high level view by understanding how their work relates with each other and to the project as a whole. Another interesting aspect of our work is that we can visualize the evolution of workspaces - and the emergent project evolution - either live or postmortem: since our tool stores all the workspaces' events, we can replay, stop, rewind, and visually inspect the effort at any given point in time to find trends, problems, and other patterns of interest.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

In order to allocate resources effectively, managers need to rely on their experience backed by code complexity metrics. But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10{\%} points higher than for models built from complexity metrics. In addition, network measures could identify 60{\%} of the binaries that the Windows developers considered as critical-twice as many as identified by complexity metrics.},

  abstract = {Process mining has emerged as a way to analyze processes based on the event logs of the systems that support them. Today's information systems (e.g., ERP systems) log all kinds of events. Moreover, also embedded systems (e.g., medical equipment, copiers, and other high-tech systems) start producing detailed event logs. The omnipresence of event logs is an important enabler for process mining. The primary goal of process mining is to extract knowledge from these logs and use it for a detailed analysis of reality. Lion's share of the efforts in this domain has been devoted to control-flow discovery. Many algorithms have been proposed to construct a process model based on an analysis of the event sequences observed in the log. As a result, other aspects have been neglected, e.g., the organizational setting and interactions among coworkers. Therefore, we focus on organizational mining. We will present techniques to discover organizational models and social networks and show how these models can assist in improving the underlying processes. To do this, we present new process mining techniques but also use existing techniques in an innovative manner. The approach has been implemented in the context of the ProM framework and has been applied in various case studies. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by analyzing the logs of a municipality in the Netherlands. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ownership and ownership awareness are also issues in open-source software (OSS) projects. Indeed, the membership in OSS projects is dynamic with team members arriving and leaving. In large open source projects, specialists who know the system very well are considered experts. How can one identify the experts in a project by mining a particular repository like the source code? Have they gotten help from other people? We provide an approach using classification of the source code tree as a path to derive the expertise of the committers. Because committers may get help from other people, we also retrieve their contributors. We also provide a visualization that helps to further explore the repository via committers and categories. We present a prototype implementation that describes our research using the Apache HTTP Web server project as a case study.},

While for many program comprehension purposes, it is sufficient to model a single version of a system, there are types of information that can only be recovered when the history of a system is taken into account. Logical coupling, the implicit dependency between software artifacts that have been changed together, is an example of such information. Previous research has dealt with low-level couplings between files, leading to an explosion of the data to be analyzed, or has abstracted the logical couplings to the level of modules, leading to a loss of detailed information. In this paper, we present a visualization-based approach that integrates logical coupling information at different levels of abstraction. This facilitates an in-depth analysis of the logical couplings, and at the same time, leads to a characterization of a system's modules in terms of their logical coupling. The presented approach supports the retrospective analysis of a software system and maintenance activities such as restructuring and redocumentation. We illustrate retrospective analysis on two large open-source software systems.},

DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators, rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

Codebook handles a larger variety of problems than prior work, analyzes more kinds of work artifacts, and can be customized by and for end-users.

Information on performed actions, concerned artifacts, references and new work, shows the work management purpose of work descriptions. Information on problems, rationale and experience shows their knowledge sharing purpose.

Software engineering researchers have investigated this kind of dependency to assess fault-proneness, detect design issues, infer code decay, and predict likely changes in code. Despite the acknowledged relation between logical dependencies and software quality, the nature of the logical dependencies is unknown in the literature. Most authors hypothesize about their origins, but no empirical study has been conducted to investigate the real nature of these dependencies. In this paper, we investigated the origins of logical dependencies by means of a case study involving a Java FLOSS project. We mined the project repository, filtered out irrelevant data based on statistical analyses, and performed a manual inspection of the logical dependencies to identify their origins using information from the revision comments, code diffs, and informal interviews held with the developers of the analyzed project. Preliminary results showed that logical dependencies involved files that changed together for a series of different reasons, which ranged from changing software license to refactoring classes that belonged to the same semantic class. {\textcopyright}2011 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Software developers' activities are in general recorded in software repositories such as version control systems, bug trackers and mail archives. While abundant information is usually present in such repositories, successful information extraction is often challenged by the necessity to simultaneously analyze different repositories and to combine the information obtained. We propose to apply process mining techniques, originally developed for business process analysis, to address this challenge. However, in order for process mining to become applicable, different software repositories should be combined, and “related” software development events should be matched: e.g., mails sent about a file, modifications of the file and bug reports that can be traced back to it. The combination and matching of events has been implemented in FRASR (Framework for Analyzing Software Repositories), augmenting the process mining framework ProM. FRASR has been successfully applied in a series of case studies addressing such aspects of the development process as roles of different developers and the way bug reports are handled.},

An important fact is the evolution of process artifacts over time as they are touched by different people in the context of a knowledge-intensive process. This highlights the need for tracking process artifacts in order to find out their history (artifact versioning) and also provenance (where they come from, and who touched and did what on them). We present a framework, simple abstractions and a language for analyzing cross-cutting aspects (in particular versioning and provenance) over process artifacts. We introduce two concepts of timed-folders to represent evolution of artifacts over time, and activity-paths to represent the process which led to artifacts. The introduced approaches have been implemented on top of FPSPARQL, Folder-Path enabled extension of SPARQL, and experimentally validated on real-world datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract  = {Software product management covers both technical and business activities to management of products like roadmaps, strategic, tactical, and release planning. In practice, one product manager is seldom responsible for all these activities but several persons share the responsibilities. Therefore, it is important to understand the boundaries of product managers' work in managing software products, as well as the impact a product manager has on the company business. The purpose of the study is to clarify what roles of software product managers exist and understand how these roles are interrelated with each other and the whole structure and business of an organization. The study is designed as an interpretative qualitative study using grounded theory as the research method. Based on the gathered data we developed a framework that reveals the role of a product manager in the organization and shows how this role can evolve by extending the level of responsibilities. Using the framework, we identified four stereotypical roles of product managers in the studied organizations: experts, strategists, leaders, and problem solvers. The presented framework shows that product managers' roles are not limited to the conception of the "mini-CEO." The results allow product managers and top management to collaborate effectively by assigning responsibilities and managing expectations by having a common tool for understanding the role of product managers in the organization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

But even when there is a joint design for a particular business process, the way individual organizations carry out that process may differ - either wittingly or unwittingly. This paper proposes an analytical approach that helps to compare how different organizations execute essentially the same process. This comparison is based on the alignment of recorded process behavior with explicitly defined process models. The distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it supports the comparison of the actual execution of a process within a particular organization with its intended design, as well as with the variants of that design by other organizations. In this way, organizations can develop a better understanding of how they can work together and further standardize a process of common interest. We include an industrial case study from the context of the CoSeLoG project to demonstrate the value of this comparison approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

  abstract = {Organizations increasingly initiate Internet-based innovation-contest communities through which individuals can interact and contribute to the innovation process. To successfully manage these communities, organizations need to understand what roles members assume, how they communicate and vary in their contribution behavior. In this exploratory study, we investigate the heterogeneous roles of contest participants based on an international innovation-contest community. We identify six user types associated with various behavioral contribution patterns by using cluster and social network analysis. The six user types further differ in their communicative content and contribution quality. Our paper contributes to a better theoretical understanding of distinctive user types in innovation-contest communities, their role in the community, and their contribution to the success of innovation contests in the era of social software. From a managerial perspective, the study provides guidance for contest platform design and appropriate reward structures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Currently-used expertise metrics are agnostic to contributor roles and can lead to incorrect characterizations. To address these issues, we operationalize contributor expertise and role. First, we revisit current expertise metrics and show that their use bundles many different aspects, creating ambiguity. Second, we introduce clearly-defined contributor roles, which capture multiple project facets. Third, we propose a graph model, based on contributor collaborations, that captures the hierarchical structure of the contributor community in a concise yet informative way. We demonstrate the model's usefulness in two ways: (a) for identifying the structure and evolution of contributor interactions, (b) for predicting contributor roles. We substantiate our study using two large open-source projects, Fire fox and Eclipse. Our systematic approach clarifies and isolates contributor role and expertise, and sheds light onto the dynamics of contributors within software projects.},

  abstract = {Context Prior research has established that a few individuals generally dominate project communication and source code changes during software development. Moreover, this pattern has been found to exist irrespective of task assignments at project initiation. Objective While this phenomenon has been noted, prior research has not sought to understand these dominant individuals. Previous work considering the effect of team structures on team performance has found that core communicators are the gatekeepers of their teams' knowledge, and the performance of these members was correlated with their teams' success. Building on this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core developers' attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change over the course of their project, based on the analysis of repository data. Method We first used social network analysis (SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select artifacts from ten different software development teams. These procedures were also used to select central practitioners among these teams. We then applied psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis (CA) techniques to interpret the content of these practitioners' messages. Finally, we inspected these core developers' activities as recorded in system change logs at various points in time during systems' development. Results Among our findings, we observe that core developers' attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors were linked to their involvement in actual software development and the demands of their wider project teams. However, core developers appeared to naturally possess high levels of insightful characteristics, which became evident very early during teamwork. Conclusions Project performance would likely benefit from strategies aimed at surrounding core developers with other competent communicators. Core developers should also be supported by a wider team who are willing to ask questions and challenge their ideas. Finally, the availability of adequate communication channels would help with maintaining positive team climate, and this is likely to mitigate the negative effects of distance during distributed developments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main novelty of our approach is the combination of an intuitive tag cloud visualization with an underlying concept lattice that provides a formal structure for navigation. ConceptCloud supports concurrent navigation in multiple linked but individually customizable tag clouds, which allows for multi-faceted repository browsing and for the construction of unique visualizations. We describe the mathematical foundations and implementation of our approach, and use ConceptCloud to quickly gain insight into the team structure and development process of two projects.},

  abstract = {Role mining is to define a role set to implement the role-based access control (RBAC) system and regarded as one of the most important and costliest implementation phases. While various role mining models have been proposed, we find that user experience/perception-one ultimate goal for any information system-is surprisingly ignored by the existing works. One advantage of RBAC is to support multiple role assignments and allow a user to activate the necessary role to perform the tasks at each session. However, frequent role activating and deactivating can be a tendinous thing from the user perspective. A user-friendly RBAC system is expected to assign few roles to every user. So in this paper we propose to incorporate to the role mining process a user-role assignment constraint that mandates the maximum number of roles each user can have. Under this rationale, we formulate user-oriented role mining as the user role mining problem, where all users have the same maximal role assignments, the personalized role mining problem, where users can have different maximal role assignments, and the approximate versions of the two problems, which tolerate a certain amount of deviation from the complete reconstruction. The extra constraint on the maximal role assignments poses a great challenge to role mining, which in general is already a hard problem. We examine some typical existing role mining methods to see their applicability to our problems. In light of their insufficiency, we present a new algorithm, which is based on a novel dynamic candidate role generation strategy, tailored to our problems. Experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract        = {CONTEXT
Process assessments are performed to identify the current maturity of organizations in relation to best practices. Existing process assessment methods, although widely used, have limitations such as: dependence on the competencies of appraisers; high amount of effort and resources required; subjectivity to analyze data and to judge on the implementation of practices; low confidence in sampling and its representativeness. Currently, due to the increasing use of information systems to support process execution, detailed information on the implementation of processes are recorded as event logs, transaction logs, etc. This fact enables the usage of process mining techniques as a powerful tool for process analysis. It allows using a significant amount of data with agility and reliability for process assessments. 

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this paper is to present the development and application of a feasible, usable and useful method, which reduces the limitations of current SCAMPI method and defines how to apply process mining techniques in SCAMPI-based process assessments 

METHOD
Research method comprises nine steps that were performed in a manner that raised questions in the first four steps were answered by the last four steps of the research design. 

RESULTS
The method “Process Mining Extension to SCAMPI” was designed, developed, applied in two cases and submitted for review by experts who judged it viable, usable, and useful. 

CONCLUSIONS
As per this research, process mining techniques are suitable to be applied in software process assessments since they are aligned with the purposes of data collection and analysis tasks. In addition to that, the resulting method was judged by experts as something that reduces identified limitations of one of the most used process assessment method.},

	abstract = {The idea of iteration is inherent to systems analysis and design methodologies and practices. In this essay we explore the notion of iteration, and distinguish two dimensions of iteration: iterations inherent in cognitive processes and iterations over representational artifacts. Cognitive iterations can be concerned with the design; the design process; or stages within the design process. Representational artifacts can take the form of documentation or the software code itself. We identify and discuss the promise of {\^{a}} iterative development{\^{a}} and compare this promise to empirical findings on the effects of iterative methods. The findings are generally consistent with expected outcomes. We conclude with an observation and more traditional that the difference between {\^{a}} iterative development{\^{a}} methodologies lies not in the presence of iteration, but in the locus of visibility and control, and the associated timing and granularity.},

	abstract = {How do moderation policies affect online discussion? This article analyzes nearly a quarter of a million anonymous comments over a 14-month period from two online Reddit forums matched in topic and size, but with differing moderation policies of “safe space” and “free speech.” I found that in the safe space, moderators removed significantly more comments, and authors deleted their own comments significantly more often as well, suggesting higher rates of self-censorship. Looking only at relatively low frequency posters, I found that language in the safe space is more positive and discussions are more about leisure activities, whereas language in the free speech space is relatively negative and angry, and material personal concerns of work, money, and death are more frequently discussed. Importantly, I found that many of these linguistic differences persisted even in comments by users who were concurrently posting in both subreddits. Altogether, these results suggest that differences in moderation policies may affect self-censorship and language use in online space, implicating moderation policies as key sites of inquiry for scholars of democratic discussion.},

@article{Zhang2016,
	abstract = {Recently, many researches propose that social media tools can promote the collaboration among developers, which are beneficial to the software development. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to confirm that using @-mention has indeed a beneficial impact on the issues in GitHub. In order to begin investigating such claim, we examine data from two large and successful projects hosted on GitHub, the Ruby on Rails and the AngularJS. By using qualitative and quantitative analysis, we give an in-depth understanding on how @-mention is used in the issues and the role of @-mention in assisting software development. Our statistical results indicate that, @-mention attracts more participants and tends to be used in the difficult issues. @-mention favors the solving process of issues by enlarging the visibility of issues and facilitating the developers' collaboration. Our study also build an @-network based on the @-mention database we extracted. Through the @-network, we investigate its evolution over time and prove that we certainly have the potential to mine the relationships and characteristics of developers by exploiting the knowledge from the @-network.},

@article{Gregor2020,
	abstract = {This essay derives a schema for specifying design principles for information technology-based artifacts in sociotechnical systems. Design principles are used to specify design knowledge in an accessible form, but there is wide variation and lack of precision across views regarding their formulation. This variation is a sign of important issues that should be addressed, including a lack of attention to human actors and levels of complexity as well as differing views on causality, on the nature of the mechanisms used to achieve goals, and on the need for justificatory knowledge. The new schema includes the well-recognized elements of design principles, including goals in a specific context and the mechanisms to achieve the goal. In addition, the schema allows: (1) consideration of the varying roles of the human actors involved and the utility of design principles, (2) attending to the complexity of IT-based artifacts through decomposition, (3) distinction of the types of causation (i.e., deterministic versus probabilistic), (4) a variety of mechanisms in achieving aims, and (5) the optional definition of justificatory knowledge underlying the design principles. We illustrate the utility of the proposed schema by applying it to examples of published research.},

@article{Malinova2022,
	abstract = {The design and improvement of business processes is of central importance for realizing benefits of information systems. A broad spectrum of methods has been proposed since the 1990s, which ranges into several dozen. It is unclear whether this large number trivially stems from copying and relabeling or whether there are substantial differences in these methods that can be tied to their applicability in different contexts or to the pursuit of different goals. Accordingly, we ask: Which activities do process improvement methods have in common, how do they differ, and why? In this paper, we approach these research questions using a multi-method design integrating techniques from systematic literature review, process mining, and statistical analysis. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a framework with 264 activities clustered in six stages that could be used for incrementally and radically improving processes. Second, we find that methods map to different configurations of the three dimensions described by the redesign orbit. Third, we uncover similarities and differences of the different methods contingent to the factors industry, objectives and whether a method is proposed or applied. Fourth, we observe three distinct clusters of method activities, which show that different strategies play a role when choosing a method for improvement. Our findings have important implications for the application of improvement methods in various improvement scenarios.},

@article{Zellner2011,
	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a structured overview of so-called business process improvement (BPI) approaches and their contribution to the actual act of improving. Even though a lot is said about BPI, there is still a lack of supporting the act of improving the process. Most approaches concentrate on what needs to be done before and after the improvement act, but the act of improving itself still seems to be a black box. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is mainly based on a review of literature that deals with the term "Business Process Improvement". The analysis of the literature is supported by qualitative content analysis. The structure of the evaluation follows the mandatory elements of a method (MEM). Findings: A lot of literature and consulting approaches deal with the restructuring and improvement of business processes. The author finds that even so-called BPI approaches do not describe the act of improvement itself. And if they do, they lack a methodological structure that can be reused. Research limitations/implications: To constrain the complexity of this research at this first stage of investigation only the search criterion "business process improvement" was used in the database search (EBSCO and Emerald). Originality/value: The paper is valuable for academics and practitioners because the impact of BPI on organizational performance is high. Its originality is in the structured evaluation of so-called BPI approaches according to the MEM, which so far no one has investigated. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
